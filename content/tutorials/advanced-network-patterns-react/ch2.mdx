### Starting Simple in React Data Fetching

Imagine a simple React application: a profile page where a logged-in user can view their profile. To achieve this, we need to fetch the user's information from an API using their ID.

The API endpoint we'll use returns basic user information. It's designed to include a delay, allowing us to later examine how slow API responses can impact frontend performance.

Consider this API call:

```shell
curl http://localhost:1573/users/u1
```

And the expected response:

```json
{
  "id": "u1",
  "name": "Juntao Qiu",
  "bio": "Developer, Educator, Author",
  "interests": [
    "Technology",
    "Outdoors",
    "Travel"
  ]
}
```

In a typical React setup, we would handle this data fetching within a `useEffect` call. React triggers this effect after completing the initial render.

Here's how you might implement this in `src/profile.tsx`:

```tsx title="src/profile.tsx" {4-11}
const Profile = ({ id }: { id: string }) => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState<User | undefined>();

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchUser = async () => {
      const data = await get<User>(`/users/${id}`);
      setUser(data);
    };

    fetchUser();
  }, [id]);

  return (
    <div>
      {user && user.name}
    </div>
  );
};
```

The `get` function is a straightforward wrapper around the native `fetch`. You can replace it with `axios.get` or any other preferred method.

Here's the utility function in `utils.ts`:

```ts title="utils.ts"
const baseurl = "http://localhost:1573";

async function get<T>(url: string): Promise<T> {
  const response = await fetch(`${baseurl}${url}`);

  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error("Network response was not ok");
  }

  return await response.json() as Promise<T>;
}

export { get };
```

To render the `Profile` component, update `App.tsx` as follows:

```tsx title="App.tsx"
import { Profile } from "./src/profile.tsx";

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="max-w-3xl m-auto my-4 text-slate-800">
      <h1 className="text-4xl py-4 mb-4 tracking-wider font-bold">Profile</h1>
      <div className="rounded border p-6 border-slate-300">
        <Profile id="u1" />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Visualizing the rendering sequence over time, it would look something like this diagram:

![Fetch and then render](/tutorials/advanced-network-patterns-react/ch2/fetch-then-render.png)

When a user accesses a React application, a typical flow begins with the browser downloading the initial HTML. As it parses the HTML, it encounters links to resources like JS and CSS. This process involves downloading, parsing, and executing JS bundles, building the CSSOM, and so on.

<InfoBox>
  Note: HTML parsing is usually done in a streaming manner, meaning it starts as soon as some bytes are received rather than waiting for the entire HTML to download. For simplicity, our illustration assumes the entire HTML is downloaded before DOM construction. More details can be found in [Rendering on the Web](https://web.dev/articles/rendering-on-the-web), [Client-side rendering of HTML and interactivity](https://web.dev/articles/client-side-rendering-of-html-and-interactivity), and [Populating the page: how browsers work](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/How_browsers_work).
</InfoBox>

As JavaScript executes, React begins rendering and manipulating the DOM, then triggers a network request through `useEffect`. It waits until data returns from the server before re-rendering with the new data.

To enhance user experience, we can introduce a `Spinner` component during data loading and an `Error` component for handling issues like unresponsive backends or nonexistent users.

With these additions, the `Profile` component now includes additional states:

```tsx title="src/profile.tsx" {2,3,23-25,27-29}
const Profile = ({ id }: { id: string }) => {
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState<boolean>(false);
  const [error, setError] = useState<Error | undefined>();

  const [user, setUser] = useState<User | undefined>();

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchUser = async () => {
      try {
        setLoading(true);
        const data = await get<User>(`/users/${id}`);
        setUser(data);
      } catch (e) {
        setError(e as Error);
      } finally {
        setLoading(false);
      }
    };

    fetchUser();
  }, [id]);

  if (loading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  if (error) {
    return <div>Something went wrong...</div>;
  }

  return (
    <>
      {user && user.name}
    </>
  );
};
```

This structure should be familiar if you've worked with React before.

Next, let's add more than just the username. We'll create an `About` component to display user information, adding simple styles for visual appeal.

<InfoBox>
  For brevity, I'm omitting Tailwind CSS from the code snippets. You can view the full styled components in the corresponding code repository.
</InfoBox>

```tsx title="src/about.tsx"
const About = ({ user }: { user: User }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <img
          src={user.avatar}
          alt={`User ${user.name} Avatar`}
        />
      </div>
      <div>
        <div>{user.name}</div>
        <p>{user.bio}</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

When data is correctly fetched, it renders as shown:

![User basic information fetched and rendered](/tutorials/advanced-network-patterns-react/ch2/fetched-about.png)

We now have a basic Profile page, retrieving data from a backend API intentionally delayed by 1.5 seconds.

### Implementing the User's Friends List

Consider the user's friends list, typically stored in a separate table and accessed via a different API endpoint. For example, `/users/<id>/friends`. We'll fetch this data in a new component, `Friends`.

```tsx title="src/friends.tsx"
const Friends = ({ id }: { id: string }) => {
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState<boolean>(false);
  const [users, setUsers] = useState<User[]>([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchFriends = async () => {
      setLoading(true);
      const data = await get<User>(`/users/${id}/friends`);
      setLoading(false);
      setUsers(data);
    };

    fetchFriends();
  }, [id]);

  if(loading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Friends</h2>
      <div>
        {users.map((user) => (
          <div>
            <img
              src={`https://i.pravatar.cc/150?u=${user.id}`}
              alt={`User ${user.name} avatar`}
            />
            <span>{user.name}</span>
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export { Friends };
```

The structure of the `Friends` component mirrors that of `Profile`: managing state, fetching data in `useEffect`, and rendering based on loading, error, and successful data retrieval states.

We can incorporate `Friends` into the `Profile` component like any regular React component:

```tsx title="src/profile.tsx"
const Profile = () => {
	//...

	return (
    <>
      {user && <About user={user} />}
      <Friends id={id} />
    </>
  );
}
```

At first glance, this implementation seems fine. However, if you consider the time taken for each API call, you might spot a potential issue. What if the `/friends` API also takes 1.5 seconds to respond? The total time to display the full page would be 3 seconds.
