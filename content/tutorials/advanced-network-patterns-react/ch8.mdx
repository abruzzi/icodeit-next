Static Site Generation (SSG) is a vital technique in modern web development for pre-rendering pages at build time, contrasting with on-demand rendering in traditional server-side rendering. This approach, especially within frameworks like Next.js, involves creating static HTML files for each page during the build process.

SSG does not restrict your site from being dynamic. Post the initial rendering, client-side JavaScript can still enable dynamic behaviors. The 'static' aspect pertains to the first render of the page, after which interactivity is managed by client-side JavaScript.

So far, we've seen runtime requests where the data required, like a user's profile, is unknown until the client makes a request. In contrast, certain data, such as universal advertisements or announcements, can be known and generated at build time. These types of data, which don't change per request, are ideal candidates for SSG.

For instance, in a `Home` page displaying advertisements (which are static for all visitors), Next.js can pre-render this content at build time using static routing. A sample implementation might look like this:

```tsx title="app/page.tsx" {2}
export default async function Home() {
  const ads = await getAds();
  return (<Ads ads={ads} />);
}
```

Accessing the home page (`/`) results in almost no latency, as the HTML content is already rendered, akin to a traditional static website.

However, routes like `/user/<id>` are different, as they require information at request time, like `/users/u1/friends`.

## Mixing Server-Side Rendering and Static Site Generation

In Next.js, you can blend SSG and SSR in dynamic routing. For instance, pre-generating certain user profiles can be achieved with `generateStaticParams`.

```tsx title="app/user/[id]/page.tsx" {2} /params/
export function generateStaticParams() {
  return [{ id: "u1" }, { id: "u2" }, { id: "u3" }];
}

export default async function Page({ params }: PageProps) {
  return <Profile id={params.id} />;
}
```

At build time, Next.js calls `generateStaticParams`, using the results to pre-render pages:

```tsx
generateStaticParams().forEach(param => <Page params={param} />)
```

The result is pre-rendered HTML pages, so when users in `generateStaticParams` visit their profiles, the content is already there and loads blazingly fast.

This approach eliminates frontend data requests for pre-rendered users:

However, pre-rendering all data at build time can be impractical due to the volume of data and its dynamic nature. That's where a mix of SSG, SSR, and client-side fetching becomes crucial:

Initially, non-real-time data (like user bio, friends list) is pre-rendered into static HTML. For each request, SSR can be used for up-to-date information, and user interactions trigger further client-side data fetching.

In the next chapter, we'll explore using user skeleton components to enhance the perceived responsiveness of these dynamic data fetches
