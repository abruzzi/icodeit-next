Chapter 5 introduced lazy loading in the client-side context, demonstrating how separating non-essential content into different bundles can enhance initial rendering and user experience. While Next.js accelerates initial rendering with static rendering, streaming, and server-side rendering, implementing lazy loading and preloading further optimizes the application. These techniques are especially beneficial for users who don't require access to all content immediately.

## Dynamic Load in Next.js

In Next.js, `next/dynamic` is a tool for dynamic component importing, it is a composite of `React.lazy()` and `Suspense`. It's particularly useful for optimizing the loading of components that are not immediately necessary on the initial render, thereby enhancing the performance and user experience of your application.

In the example below, the `Gallery` component is imported dynamically using `next/dynamic`. This means that `Gallery` will not be part of the main JavaScript bundle that loads when the page initially loads. Instead, it will be loaded only when the `App` component renders it:

```tsx {1, 3}
'use client'

const Gallery = dynamic(() => import("./gallery"));

const App = () => {
  return <Gallery />
}
```

In this case, the `Gallery` component is fetched and loaded asynchronously, only when the `App` component needs it. This approach reduces the initial load time of your application because the browser downloads fewer resources upfront.

Furthermore, `next/dynamic` allows for specifying a fallback component that is displayed while the dynamic component is being loaded:

```tsx
'use client'

const Gallery = dynamic(() => import("./gallery"), {
  loading: () => <GallerySkeleton />
});

const App = () => {
  return <Gallery />
}
```


This technique is useful for client components, allowing them to be bundled separately and loaded as needed.

## Implementing the UserDetailCard

Consider a `UserDetailCard` component that might not be immediately needed by every user. We can apply lazy loading to enhance performance:

```tsx title="components/friend.tsx", {1,14}
const UserDetailCard = dynamic(() => import("./user-detail-card"));

export const Friend = ({ user }: { user: User }) => {
  return (
    <NextUIProvider>
      <Popover placement="bottom" showArrow offset={10}>
        <PopoverTrigger>
          <button>
            <Image src={`https://i.pravatar.cc/150?u=${user.id}`} />
            <span>{user.name}</span>
          </button>
        </PopoverTrigger>
        <PopoverContent>
          <UserDetailCard id={user.id} />
        </PopoverContent>
      </Popover>
    </NextUIProvider>
  );
};
```

Here, the `UserDetailCard` is dynamically loaded only when required, reducing the initial load.


And in the `UserDetailCard` we could do the skeleton just like above:

```tsx title="components/user-details-card.tsx", {2}
async function UserDetailCard({ id }: { id: string }) {
  const detail = await getUserDetail(id);

  return (
    <Card>
      {/* same to the UserDetailCard defined in Chapter 6 */}
    </Card>
  );
}
```

And when we click a `Friend` you can see there is an additional request send (for a JavaScript chunk), and then following a network request.

![Code Split with lazy loading](/tutorials/advanced-network-patterns-react/ch11/network-waterfall-code-split.png)

You might be wondering if we could do the same `preload` technique as we have seen in Chapter 6, and the answer is yes. We could use the same `useSWR` package in Next.js, but let's try alternative - define a cache and see how we can use Server-Side Rendering to hide the request details.

## Preload in Next.js

Preloading can be used to fetch data in advance, such as when a user hovers over a button:

```tsx title="components/friend.tsx" {1, 3, 7, 16}
"use client";

const UserDetailCard = dynamic(() => import("./user-detail-card"));

export const Friend = ({ user }: { user: User }) => {
  const handleHover = () => {
    preload(user.id);
  };

  return (
    <NextUIProvider>
      <Popover placement="bottom" showArrow offset={10}>
        <PopoverTrigger>
          <button
            tabIndex={0}
            onMouseEnter={handleHover}
          >
            <Brief user={user} />
          </button>
        </PopoverTrigger>
        <PopoverContent>
          <UserDetailCard id={user.id} />
        </PopoverContent>
      </Popover>
    </NextUIProvider>
  );
};
```

While `preload` is defined as:

```tsx {8} showLineNumbers
import { get } from "@/utils/get";

export const getUserDetail = async (id: string) => {
  return await get<UserDetail>(`/users/${id}/details`);
};

export const preload = (id: string) => {
  void getUserDetail(id);
};
```

The `preload` function fetches the user's details when the user hovers over the `Friend` component. This is accomplished by triggering the `preload` function on the `onMouseEnter` event of the button element. When the mouse pointer enters the button's area, `getUserDetail(id)` is called, and it fetches the details of the user associated with the `Friend` component.

Note here in line 8 above, [the `void` operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/void) evaluates the expression (`getUserDetail(id)`) and then returns undefined, which is handy if we want to execute a function but don't care of the return value.

![Preload data when user hover](/tutorials/advanced-network-patterns-react/ch11/preload-on-hover.png)

To optimize the preloading process and prevent unnecessary repeated data fetches, we implement an internal caching mechanism using a Set. Here's the refined explanation for the provided code snippet:

```tsx title="apis.ts" {1,3,6,11}
import { cache } from "react";

const preloadedUserIds = new Set();

export const getUserDetail = cache(async (id: string) => {
  preloadedUserIds.add(id);
  return await get<UserDetail>(`/users/${id}/details`);
});

export const preload = (id: string) => {
  if(!preloadedUserIds.has(id)) {
    void getUserDetail(id);
  }
};
```

In the `apis.ts` file, we introduce a caching strategy using a `Set` to manage the preloading of user details efficiently. The `Set`, named `preloadedUserIds`, stores user IDs for which details have been preloaded. This unique collection ensures that each user's details are fetched only once, avoiding redundant network requests.

<InfoBox>
  The `cache` function [in React](https://react.dev/reference/react/cache#cache), currently in the Canary (experimental) version, is designed for use with React Server Components. It allows you to create a cached version of a function, which can be particularly useful for data fetching or expensive computations. When you call the cached function with specific arguments, it first checks if there's a cached result. If so, it returns this result; if not, it executes the function, stores the result in the cache, and then returns it.
  
  This approach can significantly optimize performance by avoiding repeated executions of the same function with the same arguments. However, it's important to note that each call to `cache` creates a new function, so calling it multiple times with the same function will not share the cache. Additionally, `cache` only works in Server Components and is for experimental use as of now.
</InfoBox>

The `getUserDetail` function fetches user details and is enhanced with React's `cache` function. This caching mechanism ensures the asynchronous operation's results are stored, reducing unnecessary data fetching. When the `preload` function is called with a user ID, it first checks if the ID is already in `preloadedUserIds`. If not present, it fetches and caches the user's details. This approach optimizes the preloading process, ensuring it only occurs when necessary and thereby enhancing application performance.

The effective use of caching in the `preload` function demonstrates a keen understanding of optimizing network interactions, ensuring that data fetching is both efficient and necessary. This consideration for performance leads us to another crucial aspect of building web applications in Next.js: the client component strategy.

## Client Component Strategy

Pushing client components to the leaf of the component tree, particularly in a server-side rendering environment like Next.js, is a strategic approach for optimizing web application performance. By doing so, you ensure that most of the page is server-rendered, which speeds up the initial load time. Interactive elements that require client-side JavaScript are loaded only where necessary, making the page interactive more quickly without overburdening the initial load.

In the provided code snippets, we have two versions of the `Friends` component. The first version marks the entire component as a client component, while the second version pushes the client-side logic down to the individual `Friend` component.

### First Version - Entire Component as Client-Side

The first `Friends` component is wrapped with `use client`, making the entire component and all its children client-side only. This means that even simple, non-interactive parts of this component won't render until the client-side JavaScript loads and executes, which can delay the initial rendering and interactivity of the page.

```tsx title="components/friends.tsx" {1,7,12}
'use client';

async function Friends({ id }: { id: string }) {
  const friends = await getFriends(id);

  return (
    <NextUIProvider>
      <div>
        <h2>Friends</h2>
        {/**/}
      </div>
    </NextUIProvider>
  );
}
```

![The boundary is set to Friends](/tutorials/advanced-network-patterns-react/ch11/client-component-friends.png)

### Second Version - Client Logic at Leaf Node

The second approach optimizes performance by removing the `use client` directive from the `Friends` component. Instead, it delegates client-specific logic to the `Friend` component. This way, the `Friends` component itself can be pre-rendered on the server, and only the interactive parts within each `Friend` component are handled on the client-side. This granular approach speeds up the initial page load, as less JavaScript needs to be downloaded and executed to render the initial view.

```tsx title="components/friends.tsx"
async function Friends({ id }: { id: string }) {
  const friends = await getFriends(id);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Friends</h2>
      <div>
        {friends.map((user) => (
          <Friend user={user} key={user.id} />
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

And we then move `NextUIProvider` usage into `friend` component.

```tsx title="components/friend.tsx" {1,5,7}
"use client";

export const Friend = ({ user }: { user: User }) => {
  return (
    <NextUIProvider>
      {/* popover code */}
    </NextUIProvider>
  );
};
```

By applying the client component at the leaf node (`Friend`), you enhance the user experience with faster initial load times and progressively enhance the page with interactive elements as needed. This approach aligns well with modern web development best practices, particularly in frameworks like Next.js, where balancing server-side and client-side rendering is key to achieving optimal performance and user experience.
