The first issue we encounter is with the rendering order. Initially, in the `Profile` component, `useEffect` triggers a network request. However, since data takes 1.5 seconds to return, we display a loading indicator in the meantime.

Once the data arrives, we render the `About` section, and a similar process occurs in the `Friends` component. Here, `useEffect` initiates another network request, waiting for the data to return.

Visualizing the request timeline, it looks like this:

![The request waterfall issue](/tutorials/advanced-network-patterns-react/ch3/request-waterfall.png)

The process involves three renderings. After the first render, the page displays a `loading...` message while initiating the `/users/u1` request. When the server responds, the `About` section is displayed. As `Friends` renders, lacking available data, it shows a `loading...` message in its section and sends out the `/users/u1/friends` request. Upon receiving this data, the third rendering occurs.

This sequence might be obvious in our current setup, but consider more complex scenarios. Imagine the `Friends` component nested deeper in the component tree or used in different pages or sections. In such cases, identifying the problem by statically reading the code becomes challenging.

The situation worsens with more nested components following the same `useEffect` + `loading` + `error` pattern, potentially leading to cumulative performance issues:

![Request waterfall could be even worse](/tutorials/advanced-network-patterns-react/ch3/more-waterfall.png)

Over time, as the component tree grows, the page becomes increasingly slower.

However, one might wonder if initiating data fetching simultaneously could mitigate this wait time.

## Sending Requests in Parallel

We can address this issue by sending parallel requests. In the `Profile` component, we can start both requests simultaneously using `Promise.all`, passing the fetched `friends` list to the `Friends` component:

```tsx title="src/profile.tsx" {11-14}
const Profile = ({ id }: { id: string }) => {
	//...
  const [user, setUser] = useState<User | undefined>();
  const [friends, setFriends] = useState<User[]>([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchUserAndFriends = async () => {
      try {
        setLoading(true);

        const [user, friends] = await Promise.all([
          get<User>(`/users/${id}`),
          get<User[]>(`/users/${id}/friends`),
        ]);

        setUser(user);
        setFriends(friends);
      } catch (e) {
        setError(e as Error);
      } finally {
        setLoading(false);
      }
    };

    fetchUserAndFriends();
  }, [id]);

	//...
};

export { Profile };
```

<InfoBox>
  The `Promise.all()` static method accepts an iterable of promises, returning a single Promise. This promise resolves when all input promises fulfill (including for an empty iterable), resulting in an array of fulfillment values. If any input promises reject, the returned promise rejects with the first rejection reason.
</InfoBox>

Consequently, we modify `Friends` into a presentational component, responding only to the passed `users` list, rather than making its own requests:

```tsx title="src/friends.tsx" /users/1-2
const Friends = ({ users }: { users: User[] }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Friends</h2>
      <div>
        {users.map((user) => (
          <div>
            <img
              src={`https://i.pravatar.cc/150?u=${user.id}`}
              alt={`User ${user.name} avatar`}
            />
            <span>{user.name}</span>
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export { Friends };
```

Now, the total wait time is reduced to `max(1.5, 1.5) = 1.5` seconds, a significant improvement:

![Send requests in parallel](/tutorials/advanced-network-patterns-react/ch3/parallel-requests.png)

The only remaining issue is the potential wait for the slower request in extreme cases. We'll accept this limitation for now and explore solutions in subsequent chapters.

## Request Dependency

Parallel requests expedite the loading of independent data. However, some requests depend on others. For example, we might need to fetch user information first and use the `interests` array from the response to retrieve recommended feeds for the user. This sequential dependency necessitates a return to the initial approach.

In the `Feeds` component, we define loading, error, and data states, and `useEffect` initiates network fetching after the initial render:

```tsx title="src/feeds.tsx" {2,3,5-15}
const Feeds = ({ category }: { category: string }) => {
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState<boolean>(false);
  const [feeds, setFeeds] = useState<Feed[]>([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchFeeds = async () => {
      setLoading(true);
      const data = await get(`/articles/${category}`);

      setLoading(false);
      setFeeds(data);
    };

    fetchFeeds();
  }, [category]);

  if (loading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Your Feeds</h2>
      <div>
        {feeds.map((feed) => (
          <>
            <h3>{feed.title}</h3>
            <p>{feed.description}</p>
          </>
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

In the `Profile` component, we include `Feeds` as follows:

```tsx title="src/profile.tsx" {5}
return (
    <>
      {user && <About user={user} />}
      <Friends users={friends} />
      {user && <Feeds category={user.interests[0]} />}
    </>
  );
```

Initially, `About` and `Friends` load, and as soon as the `user` data is available, we use `interests[0]` to fetch feeds, potentially taking another second. The overall wait time amounts to `max(1.5, 1.5) + 1 = 2.5` seconds.

![The UI after all components are rendered](/tutorials/advanced-network-patterns-react/ch3/profile-friends-feeds.png)

This approach combines parallel and sequential requests, yielding better performance than the initial method.

![The mix of parallel and sequential requests](/tutorials/advanced-network-patterns-react/ch3/mixed-parallel-and-sequential.png)

The `feeds` request must wait for the completion of the previous two requests, displaying a large `spinner` in the interim. While this solution is functional, we must consider the runtime data requirements for each specific user.
