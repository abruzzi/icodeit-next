And it is the very first problem. The order of the render is: initially in `Profile` component, `useEffect` kicks off a network request, but the data will return in 1.5 seconds, before the data is fetched we show a loading indicator.

And when data returns, we render `About`, and then in `Friends` we have the exact same flow, the `useEffect` in `Friends` kicks off another network request, and wait for the data to come back.

If we visualise the request timeline, it would be something like this:

![The request waterfall issue](/tutorials/advanced-network-patterns-react/ch3/request-waterfall.png)

There are three rendering above, after first render, the page shows a `loading...` and nothing else, and it kick off `/users/u1`request, and when data comes back from server side, it shows the `About` section of the profile, and when it renders `Friends`, because the data isn’t available it shows a `loading...` in `Friends` section, and it sends out `/users/u1/friends`, and when data returns it does the third rendering.

It might be easy to identify in our current setup, but imagine the component could be nested deeper than just one level, think about using `Friends` component in another page, or another section way down the tree - it’s then hard to see the problem by just reading the code statically.

The problem could go worth when we have more nested component following the same `useEffect` + `loading` + `error` pattern, it could leads accumulate performance issues:

![Request waterfall could be even worse](/tutorials/advanced-network-patterns-react/ch3/more-waterfall.png)

The page will be slower and slower over time - as the component tree keep growth.

However, you might be thinking can we kick off the data fetching at the same time, so we only have to wait response only once.

## Sending request in parallel

We can solve the issue through sending parallel request, and it’s pretty easy to achieve. In `Profile` we could start both request with a `Promise.all` and pass the fetched data `friends` list to `Friends` component.

```tsx title="src/profile.tsx"
const Profile = ({ id }: { id: string }) => {
	//...
  const [user, setUser] = useState<User | undefined>();
  const [friends, setFriends] = useState<User[]>([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchUserAndFriends = async () => {
      try {
        setLoading(true);

        const [user, friends] = await Promise.all([
          get<User>(`/users/${id}`),
          get<User[]>(`/users/${id}/friends`),
        ]);

        setUser(user);
        setFriends(friends);
      } catch (e) {
        setError(e as Error);
      } finally {
        setLoading(false);
      }
    };

    fetchUserAndFriends();
  }, [id]);

	//...
};

export { Profile };
```

<InfoBox>
  The `Promise.all()` static method takes an iterable of promises as input and returns a single Promise. This returned promise fulfills when all of the input's promises fulfill (including when an empty iterable is passed), with an array of the fulfillment values. It rejects when any of the input's promises rejects, with this first rejection reason.
</InfoBox>

And we will need to change `Friends` into a presentational component, meaning it only response on data (`users` list) passed in - not anymore sending request itself:

```tsx title="src/friends.tsx"
const Friends = ({ users }: { users: User[] }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Friends</h2>
      <div>
        {users.map((user) => (
          <div>
            <img
              src={`https://i.pravatar.cc/150?u=${user.id}`}
              alt={`User ${user.name} avatar`}
            />
            <span>{user.name}</span>
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export { Friends };
```

And now the overall waiting time would be `max(1.5, 1.5) = 1.5` seconds, which is pretty impressive, right?

![Send requests in parallel](/tutorials/advanced-network-patterns-react/ch3/parallel-requests.png)

Now the only issue is if one of the request returns faster, we still need to wait until the other returns - which in some extreme case can be a problem, but let’s accept that flaw for now and we can explore it in the following chapters.

## Request dependency

Parallel request can solve multiple independent requests problem and speed up the page load, when the requests can be parallel. However, not all the requests can be parallel, sometimes we need information from one request to make the following request.

For example, we need to fetch user information first, and in the response, there is a section `interests` array, and we’ll use this array to fetch recommended feeds for this user. In other words, the second request has to wait until the first request resolved.

That means we will go back to the old path, in `Feeds` component, we define loading, error and data and `useEffect` to kick off network fetching after the initial render, etc.

```tsx title="src/feeds.tsx"
const Feeds = ({ category }: { category: string }) => {
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState<boolean>(false);
  const [feeds, setFeeds] = useState<Feed[]>([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchFeeds = async () => {
      setLoading(true);
      const data = await get(`/articles/${category}`);

      setLoading(false);
      setFeeds(data);
    };

    fetchFeeds();
  }, [category]);

  if (loading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Your Feeds</h2>
      <div>
        {feeds.map((feed) => (
          <>
            <h3>{feed.title}</h3>
            <p>{feed.description}</p>
          </>
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

And in the `Profile` we use `Feeds` as following:

```tsx title="src/profile.tsx"
return (
    <>
      {user && <About user={user} />}
      <Friends users={friends} />
      {user && <Feeds category={user.interests[0]} />}
    </>
  );
```

So now the `About` and `Friends` will be loading at first, and as soon as `user` available, we use the `interests[0]` to fetch feeds, and it might take another 1 second or so until we can show it. The overall waiting time would be `max(1.5, 1.5) + 1 = 2.5` seconds.

![The UI after all components are rendered](/tutorials/advanced-network-patterns-react/ch3/profile-friends-feeds.png)

In such case, the network request is mixed with parallel and sequential, and it performant a bit better than the initial one.

![The mix of parallel request and sequential request](/tutorials/advanced-network-patterns-react/ch3/mixed-parallel-and-sequential.png)

The `feeds` request has to wait for the slowest one of the previous two to finish, and before that there is a big `spinner` shows up. The current solution looks fine, I mean that’s what it is, we anyways need data to populate the UI at run time for that particular user, right?
