highlights:
  - Implementing SWR for optimized data fetching
  - Strategic use of preload for earlier data loading
  - Balancing JavaScript bundle loading with data fetching for enhanced interactivity
leading: "As we conclude this tutorial, we reflect on the key lessons learned and set the stage for exploring server-side technology and its impact on application performance."
summary: "This final chapter wraps up our exploration of network patterns in React. We've covered parallel requests, code splitting, and prefetching to improve performance. Up next, we'll explore server-side technologies to further enhance application performance."

## New design to align with the loading pattern?

Itâ€™s also reasonable to group related information (like the user and their feeds) together, while make the `Friends` list in another section, we could use a left-right layout:
