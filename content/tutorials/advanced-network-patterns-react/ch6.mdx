## Preload

```jsx
yarn add swr
```

```tsx
const fetcher = (...args) => fetch(...args).then(res => res.json())
```

```tsx file="src/profile.tsx"
import useSWR from 'swr'

function Profile () {
  const { data, error, isLoading } = useSWR('/api/user/123', fetcher)

  if (error) return <div>failed to load</div>
  if (isLoading) return <div>loading...</div>

  // render data
  return <div>hello {data.name}!</div>
}
```

If we visualise it now you can see that the data and JavaScript can load separately and there would improve the overall interactivity greatly.

## Summary

We have tried a few ways to explore the common problems and solutions in network, async programming.

- Try to parallel network requests when possible
- Try to split code when it’s not critical for initial rendering
- Prefetch data when the lazy-loaded component need data so we can parallel the data and JS bundle together

This is all I have for the first part of the tutorial, and in the next part we’ll look into what we can do with the server side technology, what are some of the patterns there and how can we make the application performance even better. Stay tuned.
