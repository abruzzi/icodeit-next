At the end of the previous chapter, we noticed that the page now has more bytes to load initially, which might not fair for user who don't hover on a Friend component - they still need to pay for the extra network requests and JavaScript bundles.

We could delay such extra (not immediate useful) content into another request as late as possible (maybe never if the users don't ask). For example, we could split `UserDetailCard` (and its dependency) into a separate JavaScript bundle and load it whenever the user hover on it.

Let's see how to implement it in React with lazy load and suspense.

## Lazy Loading

Lazy loading in React is a strategy to dynamically load components on-demand, improving performance for larger applications by minimizing the initial code load. React's `lazy` function, used alongside `Suspense`, renders dynamic imports as regular components, enhancing user experience and resource efficiency.

Consider this implementation:

```tsx
import React, { Suspense, lazy } from 'react';

// Lazy load the component
const LazyComponent = lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <LazyComponent />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Here, `LazyComponent` is dynamically imported using `lazy()`. The `Suspense` component wraps around `LazyComponent`, providing a fallback UI during its loading phase. When `LazyComponent` is needed, it loads on demand, improving performance by splitting the code into smaller chunks.

<InfoBox>
  Code splitting is a technique in React that enables splitting your code into various bundles, which can then be loaded on demand or in parallel. This is particularly beneficial for improving the performance of large applications. When a user navigates to a part of your application that requires a component or library, only then does the necessary bundle get loaded, significantly reducing the initial load time of the application. This is especially useful for users with slower internet connections or on mobile devices. React's `lazy` function, coupled with `Suspense`, provides a straightforward way to implement code splitting, leading to more efficient resource usage and enhanced user experience.
</InfoBox>

Applying this concept, we've updated the `Friend` component in `src/friend.tsx` to use `React.lazy` for importing `UserDetailCard`. This change ensures that `UserDetailCard` loads only when necessary:

```tsx title="src/friend.tsx" {3,6,17-19}
import { User } from "../types";
import { Popover, PopoverContent, PopoverTrigger } from "@nextui-org/react";
import React, { Suspense } from "react";
import { Brief } from "./brief.tsx";

const UserDetailCard = React.lazy(() => import("./user-detail-card.tsx"));

export const Friend = ({ user }: { user: User }) => {
  return (
    <Popover placement="bottom" showArrow offset={10}>
      <PopoverTrigger>
        <button>
          <Brief user={user} />
        </button>
      </PopoverTrigger>
      <PopoverContent>
        <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
          <UserDetailCard id={user.id} />
        </Suspense>
      </PopoverContent>
    </Popover>
  );
};
```

The code defines a `Friend` component in React that displays user information using a popover. It imports user-related types and components from `@nextui-org/react` and a local `Brief` component for displaying a summary of the user.

The `UserDetailCard` component is dynamically imported using `React.lazy` for performance efficiency, loading only when needed.

```tsx
const UserDetailCard = React.lazy(() => import("./user-detail-card.tsx"));
```

Within the `Friend` component, a `Popover` is set up with its trigger wrapping a button that shows the `Brief` user summary. When clicked, the popover displays, containing the `UserDetailCard` within a `Suspense` component. This setup ensures a loading fallback is shown while the `UserDetailCard` loads, providing detailed user information based on the user's ID. This approach optimizes loading performance by fetching detailed user data only when the popover is activated.

```jsx

<Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
  <UserDetailCard id={user.id} />
</Suspense>
```

<InfoBox>
  `Suspense` is a React component that lets your components “wait” for something before rendering. Initially introduced for React.lazy (lazy loading of components), its use has expanded to include data fetching and other asynchronous operations. `Suspense` provides a way to specify a fallback UI – for example, a loading indicator – that shows up while waiting for the component to load or data to be fetched. This helps in creating smoother user experiences in React applications, as it allows for more control over what gets displayed during the waiting period of an asynchronous operation. The integration of `Suspense` with lazy loading and other React features reflects the framework's ongoing evolution to meet modern web development needs.
</InfoBox>

This lazy loading approach is evident in the network panel of devtools, where two requests are made upon clicking `Friend`: one for the JavaScript bundle of `UserDetailCard`, and another for the user's details from the API.

Analysis the current bundles, it doesn't seem help a lot:

![Bundle size analysis](/tutorials/advanced-network-patterns-react/ch5/bundle-size-analytics.png)

Note in the chart above, the thin slice on the left hand side it the `UserDetailCard`, while the big one on the right is everything else. And if we look closely we'll find the biggest one is `framer-motion` - a package that adding the animation in React - shipped within NextUI. Obviously we don't really need animation for everything, it only used when the popover shows up.

We could further split the `Friend` into a separate bundle with NextUI components, and leave the index lightweight.

So firstly we don't import `Friend` in `Friends`, instead we lazy load it with suspense:

```tsx title="Friends" {5,13-15}
import { User } from "../types.ts";
import React, { Suspense } from "react";
import { FriendSkeleton } from "../misc/friend-skeleton.tsx";

const Friend = React.lazy(() => import("./friend.tsx"));

const Friends = ({ users }: { users: User[] }) => {
  return (
    <div className="py-4">
      <h2 className="text-lg text-slate-900 tracking-wider">Friends</h2>
      <div className="flex flex-row pt-4 gap-4">
        {users.map((user) => (
          <Suspense fallback={<FriendSkeleton />}>
            <Friend user={user} key={user.id} />
          </Suspense>
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export { Friends };
```

And in the `Profile.tsx`, we will remove `NextUIProvider` and add it as a wrapper to `Friend`, because we don't need NextUI for the whole application but the popover in `Friend`.

```tsx title="src/friend.tsx" {2, 6, 19}
//...
const UserDetailCard = React.lazy(() => import("./user-detail-card.tsx"));

const Friend = ({ user }: { user: User }) => {
  return (
    <NextUIProvider>
      <Popover placement="bottom" showArrow offset={10}>
        <PopoverTrigger>
          <button>
            <Brief user={user} />
          </button>
        </PopoverTrigger>
        <PopoverContent className="max-w-[240px] min-w-[200px] max-h-40 min-h-32">
          <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
            <UserDetailCard id={user.id} />
          </Suspense>
        </PopoverContent>
      </Popover>
    </NextUIProvider>
  );
};

export default Friend;
```

With these updates, our new analysis reveals that we have three distinct bundles: `UserDetail`, `Friend`, and `Profile`.

![Bundle size analysis after splitting Friend](/tutorials/advanced-network-patterns-react/ch5/bundle-size-analytics-nextui.png)

The largest bundle, shown in blue, corresponds to the `Friend` component. The smaller, red-tinted one at the top-left is the `UserDetailCard`, and the green-tinted one represents the `Profile` component.

This is a significant improvement. Now, the loading process works as follows: When the `Profile` component initiates parallel requests for `/users/u1` and `/users/u1/friends`, we display skeleton screens for the About section and the Friends list. As the friends data arrives and the `Friends` component starts rendering, the browser concurrently downloads the related bundle. During this time, a `FriendSkeleton` is displayed, transitioning to the `Friend` component once the bundle is fully downloaded.

Moreover, if the user doesn't hover over a `Friend`, there's no additional action. The `UserDetail` data is fetched only when the user hovers over a `Friend`, optimizing resource loading and enhancing performance.

## The potential issue

Visualizing the request process, we see a sequence similar to the network waterfall discussed in Chapter 2:

![Waterfall with lazy load visualized](/tutorials/advanced-network-patterns-react/ch5/waterfall-lazy-load-vis.png)

This observation leads to a question: is it possible to parallelize these requests to further reduce delays? Exploring this possibility could unlock more performance enhancements, especially in complex application structures.
