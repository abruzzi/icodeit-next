Let's delve further into typical frontend application scenarios, uncovering new patterns and potential avenues for performance improvement.

Consider enhancing the current Profile page. Suppose a user clicks on a friend's avatar, and we display a popover with additional details fetched from a `/users/1/details` endpoint. This feature, common in platforms like Twitter or LinkedIn, adds depth to user interaction.

To maintain focus on our main topic, I'll skip the detailed implementation of the popover itself. Instead, we'll utilize components from `nextui` for the popover behavior and `UserDetailCard.`

<InfoBox>
  NextUI is a React UI library built on top of Tailwind CSS and React Aria, offering beautiful and accessible user interfaces. Despite its name similarity and website design, it's an independent community project and is not affiliated with Vercel or Next.js.

## Install and config NextUI

Firstly, let's install NextUI into our project:

```shell
yarn add @nextui-org/react framer-motion
```

And the we will need to edit `tailwind.config.cjs`

```js title="tailwind.config.cjs" {1,8,13,14}
const {nextui} = require("@nextui-org/react");

/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.{jsx,tsx}",
    "./node_modules/@nextui-org/theme/dist/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  darkMode: "class",
  plugins: [nextui()],
}
```

And finally we'll need to wrap the Application with a `NextUIProvider`:

```tsx tilte="App.tsx" {1,5,12}
import {NextUIProvider} from "@nextui-org/react";

function App() {
  return (
    <NextUIProvider>
        <div>
        <h1>Profile</h1>
        <div>
          <Profile id="u1" />
        </div>
      </div>
    </NextUIProvider>
  );
}
```

Next let's implement the popover component with `Friend`.

### Implementing a Popover Component

A popover is a non-modal dialog that appears adjacent to its trigger element. It's often used to display additional rich content.

Here's a basic implementation using `@nextui-org/react`:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import {Popover, PopoverTrigger, PopoverContent, Button} from "@nextui-org/react";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Popover placement="right">
      <PopoverTrigger>
        <Button>Open Popover</Button>
      </PopoverTrigger>
      <PopoverContent>
        <div className="px-1 py-2">
          <div className="text-small font-bold">Popover Content</div>
          <div className="text-tiny">This is the popover content</div>
        </div>
      </PopoverContent>
    </Popover>
  );
}
```

Clicking the "Open Popover" button reveals a popover box to the right. This box contains a header "Popover Content" in bold, followed by a descriptive text. It's styled with padding and font adjustments for better presentation.

### The Trigger Component

The `Friend` component can act as a trigger for the popover. We wrap it with `PopoverTrigger` as follows:

```tsx title="src/friend.tsx"
import { User } from "../types";
import { Popover, PopoverContent, PopoverTrigger } from "@nextui-org/react";
import { Brief } from "./brief.tsx";

import UserDetailCard from "./user-detail-card.tsx";

export const Friend = ({ user }: { user: User }) => {
  return (
    <Popover placement="bottom" showArrow offset={10}>
      <PopoverTrigger>
        <button>
          <Brief user={user} />
        </button>
      </PopoverTrigger>
      <PopoverContent>
        <UserDetailCard id={user.id} />
      </PopoverContent>
    </Popover>
  );
};
```

The `Brief` component accepts a `User` object and renders its details:

```tsx title="src/brief.tsx"
export function Brief({user}: { user: User }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <img
          src={`https://i.pravatar.cc/150?u=${user.id}`}
          alt={`User ${user.name} avatar`}
          width={32}
          height={32}
        />
      </div>
      <div>
        <div>{user.name}</div>
        <p>{user.bio}</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

A click on the `Brief` component activates the popover.

### UserDetailCard Component (Fetching Data)

`UserDetailCard` is designed to fetch and display user details. The user detail includes:

```ts title="types.ts"
export type UserDetail = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  bio: string;
  twitter: string;
  homepage: string;
};
```

We use our reusable `get` function to fetch these details from the `/users/<id>/details` endpoint:


```tsx title="src/user-detail-card.tsx" {5-15}
export function UserDetailCard({ id }: { id: string }) {
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState<boolean>(false);
  const [detail, setDetail] = useState<UserDetail | undefined>();

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchFeeds = async () => {
      setLoading(true);
      const data = await get<UserDetail>(`/users/${id}/details`);

      setLoading(false);
      setDetail(data);
    };

    fetchFeeds();
  }, [id]);

  if (loading || !detail) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  return (
    <Card shadow="none">
      <CardHeader>
        <div>
          <Avatar
            isBordered
            radius="full"
            size="md"
            src={`https://i.pravatar.cc/150?u=${detail.id}`}
          />
          <div>
            <h4>{detail.name}</h4>
            <p>{detail.twitter}</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardBody>
        <p>{detail.bio}</p>
      </CardBody>
      <CardFooter>
        <div>
          <p>
            <a href={detail.homepage}>{detail.homepage}</a>
          </p>
        </div>
      </CardFooter>
    </Card>
  );
}

export default UserDetailCard;
```

This implementation appears efficient. However, a network inspection reveals increasing data transfer to the client as more third-party libraries are integrated. The additional JavaScript and CSS for the popover and `UserDetailCard` could be unnecessary for users who don't interact with these features.

![More data transferred through network](/tutorials/advanced-network-patterns-react/ch4/network-inspect-increasing-load.png)

Is it possible to delay loading these resources until needed? For instance, only loading the `UserDetailCard` JS bundle when a user clicks on a `Friend` avatar, followed by a request to `/users/1/details` for detailed information.
