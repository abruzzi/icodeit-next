# Week 1: Game News - Game Insider

In week one, we will work together to implement a page in HTML and CSS. This [mockup](https://dribbble.com/shots/19038057-Game-News-Main-Page) by designer Roman Zakhareko about game news was published on Dirbbble. It was chosen because it contains many essential elements, such as the navigation bar, the hero banner, a list with images and text, etc. Understanding how these elements are implemented in HTML and CSS will help us to implement any other more complex pages in the future.

![Design By Roman Zakhareko](week-1/game-insider.png)

In addition, this mockup is relatively simple in general and contains a limited amount of elements. This allows us to intersperse the implementation of the page with an introduction to some useful tools. Such as how to select colours from the mockup, how to use icons in HTML, how to edit code in real-time. The use and configuration of these tools is also crucial to implementing our other two designs in the following two weeks.

After this chapter, you will be able to know: how to write HTML and CSS code in Visual Studio Code editor, how to debug styles in the browser, how to deconstruct a mockup, how to use `flex` layout and how to publish your work to the public.

## Tools

> To do a good job, one must first use the right tools

### Editors

In this book, we will be using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (hereafter referred to as Code) for writing and debugging code. While there are countless editing tools out there, I have found that Code with a few popular extensions makes writing HTML and CSS easy and fun. More importantly, it is free and small enough that you don't need expensive hardware to run it. Also, you can install extensions to make Code even more efficient and customisable just for you.

After downloading the platform-specific installation package and installing it, you will get an interface that looks like this. (I will demonstrate with the Mac version in this book.)

![Visual Studio Code](week-1/vscode.png)

Before we can start, we need to install one Code extension: [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) (by Ritwick Dey). Once installed, Live Server will launch a local HTTP server and monitor your HTML/CSS changes so that the corresponding page in your browser will automatically refresh as soon as an edit is made.

![Live Server](week-1/live-server.png)

After installation, you will see a new icon in the status bar.

![Live Server Installed](week-1/live-server-installed.png)

Clicking on this icon will start a local HTTP service, and Live Server will launch your default browser and load the page.

![Live Server Launched](week-1/live-server-launched.png)

### Colour picker (optional)

We will need a colour picker as the mockup doesn't come with the colors. Depending on the platform, you may need to install different applications. On Mac, the built-in tool `Digital Colour Meter` is pretty good and does the job.

![Color Picker](week-1/color-picker.png)

In practice, designers usually would share the colour palette with developers so that you don't have to inspect yourself. But at other times, such as when you wish to do some exploration or when you only have the mockup on hand, the colour picker is a could be handy.

Well, that's all we need. Let's get started on our first page.

### Browsers

Today's browsers are extremely versatile. It can be a video player, a music player, a reader, an image viewer or an IDE! That's right, an `IDE`, and I'm not talking about an editor such as [codepen](https://codepen.io/), but inside it is a development environment itself.

For example, in Chrome on Mac, you can open the DevTool by right-clicking on any web page and click `inspect` or just pressing `Cmd+Shift+I`.

![Chrome Devtool](week-1/chrome-devtools.png)

Once in inspect mode, you can click on any element on the page to see the code. On the right-hand side, you can see the style used for the element, and you can modify them in place. Pretty amazing, right?

For example, on the `Chrome` download page, you can inspect the download button and change the rounded blue button to pink and remove the rounded corners.

![Chrome Download](week-1/chrome-editing.png)

During our process, we will frequently use the developer tools for debugging to see the effect in real-time. Once we are happy with our changes, we can then copy them back into the editor.

## Getting started with HTML and CSS

This section will introduce you to HTML and CSS in the simplest way possible. If you have some basic knowledge of HTML and CSS, you are welcome to skip this section.

All the different pages you see in your browser every day, whether a KFC order page or a news portal, a Douban book review or a Wikipedia page, a personal blog or a document editor, are based on HTML -- the Hyper Text Markup Language. Today HTML is used on the web far beyond what it was originally designed for, but understanding and mastering it is essential for you to implement any complex page.

However, what is described in HTML is only a part of the story: it's for the content part only. If you want your pages to be visually appealing, then a technique to be able to customise styles of the content is needed: CSS - Cascading Style Sheets.

With CSS, we can use selectors to find one element or a class of HTML elements and apply styles to them. Here the style can be visual elements such as background colours, font colours, borders, shadows, and logical layouts such as inner spacing (called padding)and outer spacing (called margin).

In short, we describe the content through HTML and change the style through CSS. HTML describes an unpolished house, while CSS corresponds to finishes (yes, it is sometimes possible to knock out **non-load bearing walls** to change the layout of the interior of the house).

We can discuss the relationship between the two with a small example below.

```html
<div class="container">
  <h1>HTML and CSS are awesome</h1>
  <p>
    Lorem, ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. At eum eius sequi
    dolor consectetur omnis quia necessitatibus beatae vero numquam.
  </p>
</div>
```

Inside a `div` (short for `divider`, an invisible container for other elements), we defined an `h1` (meaning heading level 1) tag and then a `p` tag (meaning paragraph).

By default, the browser would render it as something like this:

![HTML Only](week-1/html-without-css.png)

And if we define some CSS to modify the style:

```css
.container {
  max-width: 800px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  font-family: "Gill Sans", "Gill Sans MT", Calibri, "Trebuchet MS", sans-serif;
}

h1 {
  text-transform: uppercase;
  background-color: orangered;
  color: white;
}

p {
  color: #333;
}
```

We could get something more appealing like this:

![With Style One](week-1/style-1.png)

Don't worry if you don't understand everything at the moment, I'll have you covered. If we apply another style set like:

```css
.container {
  max-width: 800px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  font-family: "Gill Sans", "Gill Sans MT", Calibri, "Trebuchet MS", sans-serif;
}

h1 {
  text-transform: capitalize;
  color: orangered;
}

p {
  color: #333;
  font-weight: 100;
}
```

With no changes to the HTML, we get a completely different picture of the presentation simply by changing the CSS.

![With Style Two](week-1/style-2.png)

Here I have deliberately ignored the place of JavaScript in our projects (which is crucial in any serious web applications), as this book is primarily concerned with the combination of HTML and CSS. Additionally, `JavaScript` alone has become very rare in web development, and people are more or less need libraries or frameworks such as React or AngularJS for web applications.

### Box model

One of the core functions of CSS is to provide layout for page elements, and at the heart of layout is determining the size of an element. To understand the size of an element, we need to talk a little bit about to the box model.

When viewing a particular element in your browser's DevTool, you may have noticed a small set of boxes in the bottom right-hand corner of the page:

![Bbox Model](week-1/box-models.png)

The space that an element occupies on the page is made up of several components: the content of the element itself, the distance from the content to the border: the inner spacing (padding), the width of the border, and the outer spacing between the border and other elements (margin).

We can set these different parts independently in CSS, for example, `padding-left` to control the left inner spacing, `margin-top` to control the upper outer spacing, and `border-right` to control the right border, etc.

I could list many similar trivialities, but to keep you from getting bored, let's start implementing the mockup, where we will learn a lot about the syntax of HTML tags and CSS.

## Task of our project

Whether you're just starting to write your very first page or already experienced, the first step should be to think about the content of the page and decompose the mockup into small pieces. Generally speaking, we can disassemble the page into multiple modules in a top-to-bottom order, gradually describe each module with HTML, and finally add styles with CSS.

You can either write all the HTML at once or implement one module, add styles to it, and move on to the next one. Here, we'll implement the first page in small chunks at a time to prevent learning too much at once.

### Deconstructing the mockup

As seen from the mockup, the navigation part of it is a relatively independent component, so we can start from it. Let's do some preparatory work first, create a directory `week-1`, and create two files `index.html` and `style.css` in it. Finally, we create a subdirectory of `assets` in `week-1` for image resources.

![Folder Structure](week-1/folder-structure.png)

In `index.html` we need to set some basic HTML code, aka boilerplate HTML:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
    <title>Week 1</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- our code goes here -->
  </body>
</html>
```

If you're unsure of what's described here, don't worry, we'll barely touch this part. The `Week 1` defined in the `title` tag will appear in your browser tab, so give it a cool name if you like.

We'll be working in the `body` area throughout this chapter (including the entire book), all of our HTML code will be written inside it (almost, we may need to add external CSS links, but we will talk about it later).

Additionally, the statement `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">` indicates that we wish to use an external file in this HTML document: `style.css`. Yes, this is where we define the styles, but this file doesn't have anything yet.

Now uou can start the Live Server in Code (by clicking the Go Live button on the status bar). Once the page is loaded in browser, type some text into `body`, and you should be able to see the browser page refreshed with the edits. By default, There will be a one second delay.

### Implement the navigation bar

Let's start with the HTML of navigation bar. `HTML` is a very loose, inclusive language compared to other programming languages. Looseness means that there are many different ways to implement a component. For example, you can use `div` to represent a logical container on the page, and you can also use `article` or `section` to achieve the same purpose.

In practice, however, we need to use semantic tags, such as `h1`-`h7` for titles, `p` for paragraphs, and `article` to hold a relatively independent item and so on.

For the navigation bar, HTML has a `nav` tag available, and for the list content in `nav`, we can use an unordered list `ul` or an ordered list `ol`. Since `nav` is in the header of the page, we can use `header` as the container for the whole navigation.

```html
<header>
  <nav>
    <ul class="nav-list">
      <li class="list-item">
        <div class="logo"><span class="highlight">Game</span>Insider</div>
      </li>
      <li class="list-item">
        <a href="#">News</a>
      </li>
      <li class="list-item">
        <a href="#">Videos</a>
      </li>
      <li class="list-item">
        <a href="#">Reviews</a>
      </li>
      <li class="list-item">
        <a href="#">Staff picks</a>
      </li>
      <li class="list-item">
        <a href="#">Deals</a>
      </li>
      <li class="list-item">
        <button class="button-primary">Login</button>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
</header>
```

There are seven items in the navigation bar. Five hyperlinks are in the middle, and the first one is an icon and the last one is a button. To help CSS to select specific elements, we need to add the attribute like `class= "xxx"` (and use `.xxx` to refer it) to some elements.

![Without Style](week-1/navigation-html.png)

By default, browsers add a bullets to all `li`s, as well as some spacing to `ul` for easier reading. Browsers always assume that the page is usable without any CSS. We need to override these default styles via CSS:

```css
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

body {
  font-size: 16px;
  font-family: "Open Sans", sans-serif;
}

li {
  list-style: none;
}
```

![Reset Default Styles](week-1/after-reset.png)

Here, `*` is a special selector, which means to select all HTML elements on the page. And for all these selected elements, we apply two rules, `margin:0` to eliminate the outer space, that is, no outer padding; `padding:0` means eliminate padding, that is, there is no space between the element content and the border.

Similarly, we use the tag type `body` to select the main content area, set the font size to 16 pixels, and use the font `Open Sans` (if `Open Sans` is unavailable, the system default sans-serif font sans-serif is used) .

Additionally, we want the entire navbar to be centred on the page and have a width of 80% of the available area:

```css
nav {
  width: 80%;
  margin: 0 auto;
}
```

![Center Aligned](week-1/center-aligned.png)

Next, we want the seven elements in the navigation to be arranged horizontally, not vertically. Here we have to mention two different elements in HTML: `block-level` elements and `inline` elements (strictly speaking, there are more than two in HTML, but we will only describe the two most common ones here). Block-level elements occupy a single line by default, no matter how wide their actual content is. Inline elements keep the content on the same line.

```html
<div class="container">
  <p>This</p>
  <p>is</p>
  <p>a</p>
  <p>sentence.</p>
  <span>This</span>
  <span>is</span>
  <span>another</span>
  <span>one.</span>
</div>
```

For example, since `p` is a block-level element by default, it will be on its own line. And `span` will stay on the same line. Since most HTML elements are block-level elements, they render as many lines by default.

![Block and Inline](week-1/block-vs-inline.png)

We can use `flex` layout to override this default behaviour. `flex` one of the layout machenism in CSS. I'm not going to cover all `flex` properties here (because that is almost a book in itself), and we will only cover a few common ones here.

First, to use the `flex` layout, we need a container element, and then set the container's `display` to `flex`:

```css
.nav-list {
  display: flex;
}
```

Immediately, all elements became one line like a magic!

![Flex Layout](week-1/flex-init.png)

Next, we make some spacing adjustments, making sure the `Login` button is on the right, and the logo is on the left, and the other links are relatively centred:

```css
.list-item:last-child {
  margin-left: auto;
}

.list-item:first-child {
  margin-right: 32px;
}
```

The `.list-item:last-child` selector here will select the last child node with the class `.list-item`, and similarly, `:first-child` will select the first child.

![With Space in Between](week-1/with-space-in-between.png)

For hyperlinks, browsers will add a lot of styles by default, such as the underline and bright font colours. According to the mockup, we need to override these styles as well:

```css
.list-item a {
  padding: 0 8px;
  text-decoration: none;
  color: black;
  white-space: nowrap;
}
```

The `.list-item a` selector means to look for the `a` (hyperlink) tag in the child nodes of `.list-item`. CSS selectors are parsed from right to left, this selector when interpreted will first look for all `a`, then see if there is `.list-item` in its ancestor node, and then decide whether to apply these CSS rules or not.

![Anchors](week-1/restyling-anchors.png)

Next, let's customise the button, which has rounded corners and some white space between the text and its border. White space is very important in design. Enough white space can make reading easier and make the page more attracting.

```css
.button-primary {
  appearance: none;
  border: 1px solid blue;
  padding: 4px 16px;
  border-radius: 16px;
}
```

Usually, the logo will be an image element, but we simply use some texts to simulate it here. We need to use a thicker font and highlight the `Game` colour:

```css
.logo {
  font-weight: bold;
}

.highlight {
  color: blue;
}
```

In this way, the logo looks the same as the mockup.

![Button](week-1/button.png)

But if you look closely at the button, it doesn't align with other elements (like the red line in the image above). Alignment is another extremely important principle in design (we'll cover that in chapter three), and our brains prefer neat arrangements over disorder. In fact, horizontally aligning elements inside a container has historically been super difficult, but this problem is easily solved using `flex` layout.

On a `flex` container, just use `align-items`, and set it as `center`:

```css
.nav-list {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
}
```

Also, let's add some extra whitespace to the navigation bar to give him more breathing room:

```css
.nav-list {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  padding: 16px 0;
}
```

Here is how the "final" navigation bar looks like now:

![Navigation List](week-1/navigation-final.png)

We are now very close to the mockup, although it's not pixel prefect. Even better, using the `flex` layout, our navbar will still work well on wider screens, like the button will always be on the right side of the page, pretty cool right?

![In Wider Screen](week-1/wider-screen.png)

### Implementing the Hero Banner

Next, we can look at the hero banner section. Almost everyone website has such a section that is spacial, usually with large fonts, eye-catching pictures, and a button (Call To Action) to guide users to action (like, click it).

According to the mockup, we can divide the entire area into left and right parts. The title and descriptive text are on the left, followed by a call-to-action button. The right side is a little more complicated, containing an image and some description and rating placed on top of the image.

As mentioned above, let's write the HTML content first. It is worth noting that when writing HTML, we need to assume that the page is usable without any CSS. The title should be readable, hyperlinks is clickable and can navigate users to the new address they need, etc.

```html
<section class="hero-section">
  <section class="brief">
    <h1>Frozen Adventure</h1>
    <p>
      Destiny 2 new season will feature a new ice-covered location and a new
      dark subclass Stasis
    </p>
    <button class="button-secondary">Read more</button>
  </section>

  <section class="media">
    <div class="game-cover">
      <img src="assets/hero.jpeg" alt="destiny 2" />
      <p class="title">Desitny 2 beyond light<span class="rating">4.5</span></p>
    </div>
  </section>
</section>
```

Here you can use either a `div` or `section` as the container tag of the section. I usually prefer `section` as a container for content, and `div` as an auxiliary tag.

Also, don't use `div` unless necessary. Usually, though, the two are used interchangeably in many cases.

Before any styles, this part looks like this:

![HTML of Hero Section](week-1/hero-html-only.png)

To make the two `block-level` elements `brief` and `media` line up horizontally, what method should we use? That's right, like the navbar, we can set the container `hero-section` to be a `flex` container:

```css
.hero-section {
  width: 80%;
  margin: 2rem auto;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
}
```

Well, the horizontal arrangement is fine, but the width of the two parts seems to be uneven. The image part occupies more space, and the text is pushed to the left. We need them be half and half distributed:

![Flex Initial Attemp](week-1/hero-flex-init.png)

At this time, we need to use the `flex:1` rule for both elements in the container and set the width of `100%` for the image instead of the default width so that the image will fill the available width of its container (the `.game-cover`):

```css
.hero-section > section {
  flex: 1;
}

.game-cover img {
  width: 100%;
}
```

Note there is a new CSS syntax here: `>`. This symbol represents the immediate child node of the selected `.hero-section`. Without this direct operator, `.hero-section section` would select all `section`s inside `.hero-section`, no matter how deep it is.

![Flex Evenly](week-1/hero-flex-evenly.png)

The `flex:1` here needs some extra explanation too. This is a typical CSS abbreviation, and its full form is:

```css
flex-grow: 1;
flex-shrink: 1;
flex-basis: 0%;
```

`flex-grow` is the growth factor, that is, in a flex container, how to allocate the remaining space to the element. It is only valid if all the elements themselves are smaller than the container size. `flex-shrink` refers to the shrink factor, that is, when the width of all flex elements exceeds the width of the container, in what proportion each element should be shrunk. `flex-basis` refers to the default size of flex elements.

#### Flex layout

We can illustrate the relationship between these attributes through a concrete example.

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="box">one</div>
  <div class="box">two</div>
  <div class="box">three</div>
  <div class="box">four</div>
</div>
```

In the beginning, we set `container` as a flex container, and their child nodes `box` are automatically flex elements. But since the length of each word is not the same, the arrangement of the four boxes is like this:

![Default settings](week-1/flex-demo-init.png)

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 1rem;
}

.box {
}
```

This is because by default the CSS for flex elements is set to `flex:0`, i.e.:

```css
flex-grow: 0;
flex-shrink: 1;
flex-basis: 0%;
```

We set the `flex-grow` of all divs with `box` class to 1, which means they have the same growth factor if the container has enough space:

```css
.box {
  flex-grow: 1;
  flex-shrink: 1;
  flex-basis: 0%;
}
```

At this point, they will fill the entire container and share the space evenly:

![Distributed Evenly](week-1/flex-demo-flex-1.png)

If we set different growth factor for some elements:

```css
.box:nth-child(1) {
  background-color: lightseagreen;
  flex-grow: 2;
}

.box:nth-child(4) {
  flex-grow: 2;
  background-color: lightseagreen;
}
```

Then when the container space is sufficient, the first and fourth elements will grow faster than the other elements (as they have large `flex-grow` proportion).

![Grow faster](week-1/flex-demo-flex-grow-faster.png)

`flex-shrink` is quite the opposite of `flex-grow`. When the width of the flex container is less than the sum of the widths of all flex items, `flex-shrink` defines the ratio by which each element shrinks.

```css
.box {
  flex-grow: 1;
  flex-shrink: 1;
  flex-basis: 50%;
}

.box:nth-child(2) {
  background-color: lightseagreen;
  flex-shrink: 2;
}

.box:nth-child(3) {
  background-color: lightseagreen;
  flex-shrink: 2;
}
```

For example, in this example, we set `flex-basis` to 50%, that is, each flex element shrinks or stretches from 50% of the parent element. Obviously, because there are four elements in the container, the overall length exceeds the container, so `flex-shrink` takes effect, and the result is that the second and third elements shrink faster than the other two and are, therefore smaller:

![Shrink Faster](week-1/flex-demo-flex-shrink-faster.png)

#### Polishing the homepage banner

Well, our banner has a half and half layout now, and then we need to do some typography. Generally speaking, we can emphasise some elements through visual elements like different fonts, colours, etc., to make the subject more eye-catching and the page more balanced.

```css
h1 {
  font-size: 48px;
  font-weight: bold;
}

.brief p {
  font-weight: lighter;
  margin: 16px 0;
}
```

For customising the button and the navigation bar, we used the colour picker to get the purple value from the mockup: #4A43EB.

```css
.button-secondary {
  appearance: none;
  padding: 8px 16px;
  border-radius: 16px;
  border: none;
  background-color: #4a43eb;
  color: white;
}
```

We use `appearance: none` here to reset the browser's default style and then add rounded corners, background colour and font colour to it.

![Left Side of Hero Area](week-1/hero-left-side.png)

For the right side of the banner, we noticed that rating content overlaid on the image in the mockup. This effect of **cascading** of content requires a little explanation.

When the browser renders HTML, it arranges the elements in order, and there is no overlay (after all, overlay means occlusion, that is, some content cannot be seen). If we need some elements to **to jump out** of the arrangement process and free up the position that originally belonged to it, then we need to set the element's `position` to `absolute`.

This way, the element jumps out of the normal document flow and leaves the positioning to the developer. At this time, we can use `top`, `left`, `bottom` and `right` to control the absolute positioning of the element, the default coordinate origin of the upper left corner of the screen.

But most of the time, we don't want to take the upper left corner of the screen as the origin but a certain element. In CSS, we can set the `position` of an element to `relative` so that its child nodes will have their origin at the top left corner (instead of the screen top left corner).

In this example, we want to use the `.game-over` as a baseline and then place the description text on top of it:

```css
.game-cover {
  position: relative;
}

.media .title {
  position: absolute;
  bottom: 16px;
  left: 16px;

  color: white;
  font-size: 14px;
  font-weight: lighter;
}

.media span.rating {
  margin-left: 8px;
}
```

Finally, we made a little adjustment to the corners of the image to make the implementation closer to the mockup:

```css
.game-cover img {
  border-radius: 32px;
}
```

This results in an image with rounded corners, and a circle with a radius of 32 pixels:

![Final Touch](week-1/hero-final-touch.png)

Congratulations, we have completed the second major part of the page. Here we learned some details of `flex` layout to achieve an even distribution of elements in a flex container, and we also learned to use absolute positioning (`position: absolute`) and relative positioning (`position: relative`) to make elements Layer up to make it more visually pleasing.

### Recent News

Next comes the last section of the page: the news list. What is the first step, again? That's right, write the HTML. When writing HTML, we can roughly analyse which elements need to be marked with `class`. You don't need to be perfect at this stage.

Because when using CSS selectors later, if we find some elements that need special attention, we can always go back and add them on the tag.

The news list is relatively straightforward, consisting of a title and four articles, each with an image and a text description.

```html
<section class="latest-news">
  <h4>Latest news</h4>
  <ul class="news-container">
    <li class="news">
      <article>
        <header>
          <img src="assets/news-1.webpx" alt="news" />

        <p>

Note the new tag we use here, `article`. `article` represents a standalone entity, such as a piece of news, a tweet, a blog, etc. When writing HTML, we also need to consider how to make the content semantic, meaning one can read the HTML code directly in the editor. Many web pages were filled with redundant and meaningless tags in the early days (and today as well). When we write a page, we need to consider the readability and maintainability from the very beginning.

Well, that doesn't look very appealing. Let's add some styles to it.

```css
.latest-news {
  width: 80%;
  margin: 1rem auto;
}

.news-container {
  display: flex;
  gap: 2rem;
}

.news {
  flex: 1;
}
```

After adding `flex:1`, the news lines up correctly:

Now let's find some real game covers to make it looks authentic.

![With images](week-1/news-images-broken.png)

Oops, the whole page seems to be messed up! But don't worry. You only need to specify the size of the image as a percentage so that the image will automatically scale to its container size:

```css
.news img {
  width: 100%;
  border-radius: 1rem;
}
```

The picture scales correctly now:

In addition, we noticed that the font was too thick and larger than in the mockup, also the spacing between the title and the image was too close.

Let's fix it up:

```css
.news p {
  font-size: 14px;
  font-weight: lighter;
}

h4 {
  margin: 1rem 0;
}
```

And now the final result is like:

Looks much better, doesn't it? This completes most of the content of this page. There are some parts that I have deliberately omitted, such as the use of icons, the shadows of buttons. These topics will be covered in conjunction with design in the following chapters.

## Publish your design

Congratulations, you have completed your first reproduction from the mockup. I believe you are very satisfied with your work, you really should. So let us share this joy with your friends!

How to publish your page on a public platform, so anyone anywhere in the world can access it? We can do this with tools like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Surge](https://surge.sh/).

If you don't want to install some extra software on your machine, then `Netlify` will be easier. After registering an account, you only need to drag and drop the local directory `week-1` to its website. After a few minutes `Netlify` will complete the deployment and provide you with a URL that you can share with others, pretty straightforward.

Additionally, we'll cover a little bit about using `Surge` to publish your work here. First, you need to install [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/). After the installation, you will have the `npm` package manager in your command line.

Now, let's install the command line tool of `surge`. You need to execute it in the Terminal program:

```sh
npm install --global surge
```

Then go to your working directory, which is `week-1`:

```sh
cd ~/tutorial/3w3ps/week-1
surge
```

At this time, `surge` will prompt you to log in or create an account, and then it will randomly assign a domain name to you and complete the deployment.

You can now access the URL in public network or share it to others.

## Summary

This week, we learned how to deconstruct a mockup and write corresponding HTML documents, learned how to use the `flex` layout to implement the navigation bar, and how to control the even distribution of elements, and learned how to use absolute positioning to elements that out of the document flow, as well as some other common typography techniques (like using `padding` and `margin`), etc.

I'm sure you can't wait to do something with your new achieved skills, so here are some interesting challenges.

## Challenges

### Challenge 1

Find a website you visit frequently, and use Chrome's DevTool to inspect the site's navigation bar. See what knowledge we discussed above and what knowledge is new to you. In addition, you can try to reimplement the navigation bar by the method we introduce here.

1. Write semantic HTML tags
1. Layout with `flex`
1. Adjust typography with margin and padding

### Challenge 2

Inspect your favourite website's Landing Page, analyse its font and layout, then try to replicate it locally. You might want to pay attention to these:

1. Write semantic HTML tags
1. Use of fonts
1. The combination of background colour and foreground colour
1. Use `flex` layout
1. Adjust typography with margin and padding

In the next week, we will learn more about `flex` layout, in the vertical direction, using grids for more complex layouts, and layouting elements of different heights. We'll also cover how to use external fonts and icons to make pages more interesting.
