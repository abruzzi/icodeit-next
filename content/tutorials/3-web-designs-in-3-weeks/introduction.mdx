## Structure of this tutorial

Similar to the first edition, the book is divided into three main chapters. In fact, it is a process of implementing different styles of design, three projects in three weeks time.

The first chapter is about a typical landing page. It includes a navigation bar, a hero banner and a news list. Here we go through some environment setup, including the configuration of the tools and explanation of the basics. By the end of the first chapter, you will have learned how to deconstruct a design, write the corresponding HTML, and implement common layouts through `flex` layouts. Also you will be able to publish your website to the public and allow your friends or colleagues to access it.

Chapter two is a conceptual design for `Instagram`. It includes a vertical navigation bar, card design and more complex typography and layout. We will explore more about `flex` layout and `grid` layout. In addition, we will learn about the use of font icons and the priority of selectors in CSS.

Chapter three is a page with a responsive design. We will complete the interface on the small screen with a mobile-first strategy first, and then overrides styles to adapting to desktop version through media queries. In the process, we'll learn how to simplify HTML writing using `Emmet`, use CSS variables to eliminate duplicate code and much more. At the end of the project, we will also learn some foundamental design principles so that you can be more confident about how to implement a page on your own without a mockup.

## Style changes of new edition

The first edition had two projects plus a hands-on (build-your-own) practice. The new edition has been modified to three different projects, placing the exercises section at the end of each chapter. Regarding the distribution of knowledge, the new edition is more evenly distributed to ensure that each chapter covers some important points.

In addition, when re-reading the first edition, I found many incorrect assumptions about beginners' knowledge. Many concepts unfamiliar to beginners were not explained enough, as well as problems such as the slightly large amount of code.

In rewriting it, I tried to add as much background knowledge as possible to make each step easier for starters.

I hope you can enjoy the new edition just as you did for the first one.
