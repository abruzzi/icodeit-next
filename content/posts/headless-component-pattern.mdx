title: "Headless Component: a pattern for composing React UIs"
date: 2023-11-07T15:46:12+11:00
description: "As React UI controls become more sophisticated, complex logic can get intertwined with the visual representation. This makes it hard to reason about the behavior of the component, hard to test it, and necessary to build similar components that need a different look. A Headless Component extracts all non-visual logic and state management, separating the brain of a component from its looks."
