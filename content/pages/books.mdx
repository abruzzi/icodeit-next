description: "I'm passionate about writing because it allows me to delve deeply into a subject and examine it from various perspectives. For those who appreciate absorbing content at their leisure, books are undoubtedly an excellent choice. My preference is for a methodical teaching approach, leading my audience from the basics to a point where concepts of maintainability, testability, superior design, and inherent quality become clear and logical."

  with the modern (also the most compatible) techniques. Just like the first edition, it has all the interactive ways of
  teaching and the real-world-based design reproducing, but with the latest front-end knowledge.
