They provide the convenience to easily jump to specific sections or review previous parts at your own pace. For interactive topics such as understanding CSS flex layouts, undertaking a series of minor refactorings, or troubleshooting CSS animations, videos serve as an ideal medium to bypass extensive and cumbersome text."
